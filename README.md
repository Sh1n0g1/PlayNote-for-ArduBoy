# PlayNote-for-ArduBoy
It is a piano app for ArduBoy.
There is the stacked keyboard on the left and the history of frequency of the note you played on the right.
* All notes's frequency is calculated by ArduBoy, and the gap is less than 0.01% (e.g. A4=439.99 should be 440.00)
* The X axis means the note, and the Y axis means the octave.

Select the key with UP/RIGHT/DOWN/LEFT key and press A button to play.
