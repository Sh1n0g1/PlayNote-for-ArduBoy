## Install
Just download the .ino file and open with Arduino IDE, and write it to your ArduBoy.

## Help
There is the stacked keyboard on the left and the history of frequency of the note you played on the right.
* All notes's frequency is calculated by ArduBoy, and the gap is less than 0.01% (e.g. A4=439.99 should be 440.00)
* The X axis means the note, and the Y axis means the octave.

Select the key with UP/RIGHT/DOWN/LEFT key and press A/B button to play.

A is 3 times longer than B
